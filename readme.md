#  Quiz App

This project is to show my proficiency in Html, css and javascript. I structured this quiz project as a "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" format where users have to correctly answer a series of multiple-choice questions in order to advance to the next level / question. There are 15 questions in total and each question is worth a specific amount of money and a time limit is placed on user to come up with an answer otherwise, you loose the game. Contestants also get three Lifelines to assist them if they get stuck on a particular question.

More updates on the game later .....
